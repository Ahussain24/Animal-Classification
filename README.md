Around 270 imahge total images were collected for the purpose(50 for each category, 70 for horse).

We augmented the dataset to generate more samples( 4 images from 1 images) by applying various image transformation technique.
After augmentaion our dataset consist of more than 250 images for each catageory.


To generate for sample from the current dataset. execute the "ImageAugmentation.ipynb" file in the current repository
